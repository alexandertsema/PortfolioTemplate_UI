The layout is powered by pure Flexbox and CSS3 along with HTML5. To support gestures on mobile devices I've integrated HammerJS. This website template is SEO optimized with a help of dynamic meta tags, titles, and slugs. I use yarn instead of npm and there is a custom production build script which compresses bundles with gzipper. All the content could be pulled from any CMS via API calls. There is another <a href='/projects/details/portfolio-template-asp.net-core-ms-sql-server-2'>project</a> in my portfolio with the custom CMS designed for this template.</p><p>By the way, this website is using this template. It is deployed as a static website on Google Cloud Platform bucket."
