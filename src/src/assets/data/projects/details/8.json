    "text": "<p>This is another approach to solve the problem of indoor localization. This time I used a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The idea was to combine sequential spatial and visual data in one complex neural network to benefit from both dimensions. The CNN was used to extract high-level features from each omnidirectional frame of the video stream then this data was combined with spatial geo data and passed to the RNN.</p><p>This time I used a virtual machine with GPU on Google Cloud Platform, so the learning process was sped up tremendously. But still, both data labeling and learning were very complicated processes and needed to be automated to a certain degree.</p><p>This project didn't give desired results and didn't overbid <a href='/projects/details/indoor-localization-scene-classifier-python-tensorflow-numpy-3'>the previous algorithm</a>, though I believe the concept itself is promising.</p>"
