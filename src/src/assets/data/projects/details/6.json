OneTwoPrint is an autonomous vending machine which prints photos from Instagram. We have been producing those machines from the ground to up. This piece of the system is the core component as it represents the UI of the vending machine. It interacts with the hardware (printer and bill acceptor), to Instagram API and Master monitoring service which is responsible for monitoring money transactions, consumables levels, and interaction with administrators.</p><p>Unfortunately, this startup was not successful as the financial crisis made us stop the business.</p>"
