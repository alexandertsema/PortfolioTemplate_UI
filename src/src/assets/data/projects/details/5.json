    "text": "<p>A lot of low budget organizations still keep their own servers and sometimes system administrator needs to check the performance of the certain server in the environment. In order to do this he should connect to remote server using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC), TeamViewer etc and go to Task Manager manually. There are many solutions to that problem, but all of them cost money. This is free to use software with open source code which can be adjusted to any needs.</p><p>This project implements OS and hardware monitoring dashboard system for remote servers. It uses custom Web Socket protocol implementation with encrypted communication. There are several simple microservices: the Main Service works as a demultiplexer for the received from the Monitoring Service data. The microservices stay in the idle state till the first client is connected and go back to the idle state when all clients are disconnected. All data is served to the client in cozy JSON format.</p><p>This project is cross-platform and theoretically could be deployed on Windows and Unix operating systems.</p>"
